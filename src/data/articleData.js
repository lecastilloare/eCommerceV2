        desc: "Pilea peperomioides is a low maintenance species that thrives in a bright spot near a window, but it is best to keep the plant out of direct sunlight as too much direct sun can cause the leaves to burn. However, too little light can cause the leaves to fade and the plant's overall health to suffer, so take time to find a spot that's just right.If you are unsure of the lighting conditions in your home or office, check out our guide for how to measure light in your space.",

        desc: "The Fiddle Leaf Fig appreciates a warm, humid environment, a fair amount of water and plenty of light. Choose a location away from air vents and drafts where the tree will receive plenty of bright ambient light. Directly in front of, or close by a southern or western facing window is ideal, and eastern exposure can also work as long as the plant is directly in the window and the space feels very bright. A few hours of direct sun is also beneficial. If placed in a full-sun location (where the plant will receive over 6 hours of direct light daily), a humid environment will keep your Fiddle Leaf looking its best. We do not recommend this plant for windows with northern exposure. They will not thrive in low-light locations.",

        desc: "Rubber plants are very sensitive to moisture. Water burgundy only when the soil becomes somewhat dry. Slowly pour water around the plant and let it run through to the bottom. Avoid splashing the leaves as it may stain them. Cut back on watering Ficus in winter Water-soluble and well-balanced plant food specially formulated for houseplants is nutritious for rubber trees.",
